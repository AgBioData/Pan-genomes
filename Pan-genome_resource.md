# The AgBioData pan-genome resource #

### What are pan-genomes good for anyway? ###

Interest in pan-genomes has increased rapidly over the past 10 years or so. Considerable progress has been made in the construction and analysis of pan-genomes, though many big problems remain, such as standards and file formats for archiving and sharing the data, useful visualization and browsing software, and, one could argue, a clear understanding of how pan-genomes can be used to further biological knowledge and the improvement of crops and livestock. Sure, pan-genomes are fascinating from a computational perspective, *but what are they good for*?

### Terminology ###
As "pan-genome" means different things to different people, here are definitions used in this resource.

  **annotation**: The outcome of a gene model analysis
  
  **gene model**: A predicted protein-coding gene.

  **pan-gene**: A collection of gene models from a pan-genome that appear to all be the same thing.

  **pan-genome**: The sum of all sequence across the genomes/assemblies analyzed, including all variations (SNPs, CNVs, Indels, translocations, inversions).
  
  **pan-genome analysis**: An analysis carried out on a pan-genome.

### Brief history ###
In bacteria and viruses, the small genomes and proliferation of complete assemblies lead to the development of a number of construction and analysis methods, and visualizations. However, these methods and visualizations don't scale to the larger and more complex plant and animal genomes. New methods have been developed for the human and human model species pan-genomes, but these methods also don't translate easily to plants as animal genomes lack the complexities that are found in plant genomes, and pan-genomes.


### What are pan-genomes good for? ###
  **Identify core, variable (aka accessory), and rare (aka dispensable) gene models. Gene family analyses. (To what end?)**
