### Visualizing Pan-Genomes ###
[Return to top page](Pan-genome_resource.md)

Visualization of pan-genome data is a very active field of research. Visualization approaches range from very complex "hairball" graph displays, to comparisons on the gene level across multiple genomes, and from all-by-all views to pair-wise comparisons.

A good example of a pan-genome browser comes from the Mouse Genomics Informatics resource, the mouse 
[Multi-Genome Viewer](http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgv).

Visualization and browsing of the rice pan-genome is implemented in [JBrowse](http://www.ricesuperpir.com/web/riceHubAssembly).

A slide deck from 2022 summarizing pan-genome analysis and visualization software can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rU0tzl2uIhP9xk8egJX4IzTPQC3QJNn8/view?usp=sharing)
