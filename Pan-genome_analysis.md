### Constructing and analyzing Pan-Genomes ###
[Return to top page](Pan-genome_resource.md)

The construction and analysis of pan-genomes remains a young and rapidly changing field. Nonetheless, well-documented and reproducible pipelines are needed, but rarely found.

A good review of the state of pan-genome research as of 2020 can be found in [Vernikos GS. A Review of Pangenome Tools and Recent Studies. 2020 May 1. In: Tettelin H, Medini D, editors. The Pangenome: Diversity, Dynamics and Evolution of Genomes. Cham (CH): Springer; 2020.

A slide deck from 2022 summarizing pan-genome analysis and visualization software can be seen [here][https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rU0tzl2uIhP9xk8egJX4IzTPQC3QJNn8/view?usp=sharing]
